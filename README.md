Project Description
Within NegotiatePro, we hope to take data from the US census, financial reports, KPIs and third party employer data sources of individual companies as well as industry averages. By weighing the needs of the employer and employee, NegotiatePro will be able to create the optimal outcome for both parties involved.

Project Aim
Conflict within employers and employees, we believe, is not a dilemma that has no chance of resolving. While getting to a point of equilibrium often means that both parties have to give up part of their earnings, we believe that through connecting through data and statistics we can demonstrate to employers and employees that giving up a certain amount of profit will result in more success in the long run, thus the other party would also compensate their losses. Through this process, we wish to eliminate conflict as much as possible.
