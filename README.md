Project Description
Within NegotiatePro, we hope to take data from the US census, financial reports, KPIs and third party employer data sources of individual companies as well as industry averages. By weighing the needs of the employer and employee, NegotiatePro will be able to create the optimal outcome for both parties involved. 

Data Sources
Data will be sourced from the US Census, quarterly earnings as well as labor unions and laborer surveys to accurately reflect the needs from both the employer and the employee.
